## General info
The objective of this project is to apply four main techniques which are considered as the pillars
of machine learning, namely - Regression, Classication, Dimensionality Reduction and Density
Estimation. These methods will be applied to a dataset that includes data from different states of
India. It consists of parameters like SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM, PM2.5, and other meteorological
parameters useful for air quality prediction.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Software: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
* Programming Language: Python
